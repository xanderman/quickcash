Most consumer applications have way too many features.  Most people never use even 25% of the functions available in Excel, for example.  Financial applications are even worse.  Products like Quicken are far too complicated for the average user.

I, like many people, have instead been using a spreadsheet to track expenses.  Spreadsheets are inefficient for this use, and have to be coerced -- the application logic programmed into each individual cell.  Updates, like adding a budget category, are a pain.

This project seeks to combine the simplicity of a spreadsheet with the power of a dedicated application.
